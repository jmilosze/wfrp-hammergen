        <p>
          Hammergen is an online Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP) 4th Edition character generator. It lets you create,
          store, and manage characters as well as custom skills, talents, etc. You can share everything you create with
          other players! To use it, you will need a Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Rulebook, which you can buy from
          <a href="https://www.cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay/">Cubicle 7 store</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a second iteration of Hammergen. If you had account on the previous version (at
          <a href="https://warhammer.azurewebsites.net/">warhammer.azurewebsites.net</a>), your account and all
          characters are available here. To access this account and characters go to Login and use the “Forgot your
          password” link.
        </p>
        <div class="h3">What exactly can I do here?</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Auto-generate new level 1 characters using rulebook character creation rules</li>
          <li>Auto-generate high level characters</li>
          <li>Create custom Skills, Talents, Careers, Items, Qualities, Spells, and Mutations</li>
          <li>Share everything you create with other players.</li>
          <li>Generate names and physical descriptions using rulebook rules</li>
          <li>
            Generate random attribute rolls with one press of a button, appropriate racial bonuses are added
            automatically
          </li>
          <li>Select Skills, Talents, Weapons, Armor, Spells, and Mutations from searchable lists with descriptions</li>
          <li>Save your character and edit it later at any time</li>
          <li>View your character in a clear printable tables</li>
          <li>Download character in spreadsheet format</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can see example characters (even without registering) by going to Characters in the top navigation bar.
        </p>
        <div class="h3">How do I use it?</div>
        <p>
          To start making characters you need to create an account using email address as login name. We do not verify
          the email addresses so you can use a fake email, but if you do, the password reset functionality will not
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          After registering and logging in all you need to do is go to Characters (in top navigation bar), and click
          Create New button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you can also share any element you made (character, skill, item, etc.) with other players! When an element
          is marked as <b>Public</b> anyone you give your username to, can see that element in read-only mode. Sharing
          is explained in the Linked Users tab in
          <b-link :to="{ name: 'manage' }" target="_blank">Manage Account</b-link> section.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at any point you need to roll dices, you can head over to
          <a href="https://dice.hammergen.net/">Hammergen Dice</a>
          where you can roll various RPG dices by yourself or with friends.
