          Creature traits are finally here on Hammergen! You can browse them in
          <TextLink routeName="traits">Creature traits tab</TextLink> and attach them to characters. We added most of
          the published Traits (about 150).

        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">Upcoming cleanup</p>
        <p>
          To reduce storage and improve the performance, we will be deleting inactive Hammergen accounts. On 9th of
          September we will delete all accounts (and all their characters and other properties) that have not been
          active in the last 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The account counts as inactive if no one has logged in to it in the last 2 years. To avoid having your account
          deleted, please make sure you log in to your account (no need to do anything else).

    <p>
      Hammergen has almost all trappings, careers, skills, talents, mutations, spells, and qualities from WFRP 4th ed
      Rulebook and all other 4th ed books published. Full list of included source books can be fond in
      <TextLink routeName="about">About</TextLink>
      section. Each of them has a reference to the source book and page they are from. Some examples of what you can use
      filters for are:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-1">
      <li>Find all new trappings from Up in Arms.</li>
      <li>Find which source book contains Chantyman career.</li>
      <li>List all melee weapons from Fencing group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can see example characters (even without registering) by going to
      <TextLink routeName="characters">Characters</TextLink>
      in the side navigation bar.
    </p>
    <div class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-5">How do I use it?</div>
    <p>
      To use it as Warhammer database you don't have to signup or login. Just head up to the relevant section and start
      browsing!
    </p>
    <p>
      To start making characters you need to create an account using email address as login name. We do not verify the
      email addresses so you can use a fake email, but if you do, the password reset functionality will not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      After registering and logging in, all you need to do is go to Characters (in top navigation bar), and click Create
      New button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can share any custom property (character, skill, trapping, etc.) you made with other players! When a property
      is marked as <span class="font-bold">Public</span>, anyone you give your username to, can see that item in
      read-only mode. Sharing is explained in the <TextLink routeName="linkedusers">Linked Users</TextLink> tab
      available after logging in.
    </p>
