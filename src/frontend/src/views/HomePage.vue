    <p>

      store, and manage characters as well as custom character properties such as skills, talents, etc. You can share
      everything you create with other players!

      Rulebook and almost all other 4th ed books published by

      <span class="font-semibold">
        Please keep in mind that descriptions of those items are often incomplete, abbreviated, and cannot replace
        original descriptions from the source books.

    <p class="mt-1 text-xl">Warhammer database</p>
    <p>
      Hammergen has almost all trappings, careers, skills, talents, mutations, spells, and qualities from WFRP 4th ed
      Rulebook and all other 4th ed books published. Full list of included source books can be fond in
      <TextLink routeName="about">About</TextLink>
      section. Each of them has a reference to the source book and page they are from. Some examples of what you can use
      filters for are:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-1">
      <li>Find all new trappings from Up in Arms.</li>
      <li>Find which source book contains Chantyman career.</li>
      <li>List all melee weapons from Fencing group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can see example characters (even without registering) by going to
      <TextLink routeName="characters">Characters</TextLink>
      in the side navigation bar.
    </p>
    <div class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-5">How do I use it?</div>
    <p>
      To use it as Warhammer database you don't have to signup or login. Just head up to the relevant section and start
      browsing!
    </p>
    <p>
      To start making characters you need to create an account using email address as login name. We do not verify the
      email addresses so you can use a fake email, but if you do, the password reset functionality will not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      After registering and logging in, all you need to do is go to Characters (in top navigation bar), and click Create
      New button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can share any custom property (character, skill, trapping, etc.) you made with other players! When a property
      is marked as <span class="font-bold">Public</span>, anyone you give your username to, can see that item in
      read-only mode. Sharing is explained in the <TextLink routeName="linkedusers">Linked Users</TextLink> tab
      available after logging in.
    </p>
